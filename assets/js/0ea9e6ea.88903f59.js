In object-oriented programming, classes and interfaces help us with abstraction to reduce boilerplate. But, in functional programming, we use type classes. Historically, type classes in functional programming have been very complex and confusing, partially because they import ideas from Haskell that don't make sense in Scala, and partially because of their esoteric origins in category theory. In this presentation, Jorge V\xe1squez presents a new library called ZIO Prelude, which offers a distinctly Scala take on Functional Abstractions, and you will learn how you can eliminate common types of boilerplate by using it.

While it\u2019s easy to develop a basic command-line application, building one that features rich help, forgiving parsing, bulletproof validation, shell completions, and a clean and beautiful appearance is quite challenging. In this talk, Aiswarya Prakasan, a contributor to ZIO CLI, will lead you on a journey to building powerful command-line applications in Scala. Through the power of composition and strong types, you will discover how to build type-safe command-line applications in just a few simple lines of code, which give you rich features of command-line applications like git.")),(0,r.kt)("h3",{id:"zio-flow"},"ZIO Flow"),(0,r.kt)("ul",null,(0,r.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"li",href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4pMkTAsg48"},"ZIO WORLD - ZIO FLOW")," by Aiswarya Prakasan (March 2020) - Aiswarya Prakasan introducing ZIO Flow the new open-source platform will help developers orchestrate microservices for mission-critical code.

Yet, using local parallelism, it is possible to dramatically improve the performance of ML projects\u2014for example, by fetching data sources in parallel. Historically, Scala projects have used Scala's Future for local parallelism, but increasingly, many projects have begun adopting ZIO as a better Future. Although powerful, ZIO is not easy to set up with Spark. In this talk, Leo will introduce an open-source library that handles all boilerplate so you can easily implement Spark and ZIO in your ML projects, and will then present detailed benchmarks showing how much additional performance can be obtained through local parallelism.
