The CPU has to load in new registers, refill all its caches, it has to go through all these crazy complex processes that interfere with its main job to get stuff done. There's significant overhead associated with that. As a result, it's not going to be very efficient. We are going to waste a lot of our time and resources just switching back and forth between all these threads, that would kill our application."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"So for that reason, ZIO's default thread pool is fixed with a number of threads equal to the number of CPU cores. That is the best practice. That means that no matter how much work we create if we create a hundred thousand fibers, they will still run on a fixed number of threads."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"Let's say we do blocking I/O on the main ZIO thread pool, so we have got eight threads all sitting and parked on a socket read. What happens to all the other 100000 fibers in our system? They line up in a queue waiting for their chance to run. That's not ideal. That's why we should take these effects that either do blocking I/O, or they do big CPU Work that's not chunked and run them using ZIO's blocking thread pool which will give us a dedicated thread. "),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"That dedicated thread is not efficient, but again, sometimes we have to interact with legacy code and legacy code is full of blocking code.

Instead of waiting to read the next chunk from a socket or instead of waiting to acquire a lock, all we have to do is call it and give it a callback. It doesn't need to do anything else. It can return control to the thread pool and then later on when that data has been read from the socket or when that lock has been acquired or when that amount of time has elapsed if we're sleeping for a certain amount of time, then our callback can be invoked.

Error handling is really terrible, we have to do error propagation on our own.

By using ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Future"),"s we can wrap callback-based APIs and get the benefits of async but without the callbacks. Also, it supports for-comprehension, so we can structure our code as a nice linear sequence.
