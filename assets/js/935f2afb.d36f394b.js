The Scala compiler can catch a lot of errors at compile time since it is type-safe. This ensures that our code is mostly correct, and it prevents lots of bugs from creeping into the runtime. So having a type-safe editor that highlights errors will improve our development experience.

We have to document our configuration so it is clear to IT and DevOps how to configure our applications. We have to do strong validation with error accumulation to ensure bad data is rejected and good error messages are generated for end-users. In this presentation, Afsal Thaj, the author of ZIO Config, shows attendees how to solve all of these problems in a composable and testable way. By separating the description of configuration from what must be done with the configuration, ZIO Config provides all standard features\u2014including multiple data sources, data source overrides, documentation, and validation with error accumulation\u2014for free.

With zio-kafka you can use a single Consumer instance for multiple streams from different topics. It is not only easier to create a single Consumer layer instead of one for each topic, but it may be more resource efficient as well.
